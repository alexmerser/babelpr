"My friend said to me, ""I think the weather's trippy."" I said, ""No, man, it's not the weather that's trippy, perhaps it is the way that we perceive it that is indeed trippy."" Then I thought, ""Man, I should have just said, 'Yeah.'"""

"I think Bigfoot is blurry, that's the problem. It's not the photographer's fault. Bigfoot is blurry, and that's extra scary to me. There's a large, out-of-focus monster roaming the countryside. Run, he's fuzzy, get out of here."

"If I was a locksmith I'd be fuckin' pimpin' that shit out. ""Say, what's goin' on, man? Tell you what. I'll trade you a free key duplication(laughs)."" That joke made me laugh before I could finish it. Which is good 'cause there's no ending."
"I was gonna get a candy bar; the button I was supposed to push was ""HH"", so I went to the side, I found the ""H"" button, I pushed it twice. Fuckin'...potato chips came out, man, because they had an ""HH"" button for Christ's sake! You need to let me know. I'm not familiar with the concept of ""HH"". I did not learn my AA-BB-CC's. God god, dammit dammit."

I'm saved by the buoyancy of citrus."
"I got so much tartar, I don't have to dip my fishsticks in shit! That's, that's actually kind of gross, you know? After that joke, I always clarify that I'm just jokin'. I do not know how much tartar I actually have. I believe it's the average amount. If we all took a tartar test right now, my name would be right in the fuckin' middle."
"Fish are always eating other fish. If fish could scream, the ocean would be loud as shit. You would not want to submerge your head, nothing but fish going ""Ahhh, fuck! I thought I looked like that rock!"""
"I can't tell you what hotel I'm stayin' in, but there are 2 trees involved. They said, ""Let's call this hotel 'Something Tree'"". So they had a meeting, it was...it was quite short.

"I was walking by a dry cleaner at 3 a.m., and it said ""Sorry, we're closed."" You don't have to be sorry. It's 3 a.m., and you're a dry cleaner. It would be ridiculous for me to expect you to be open. I'm not gonna walk by at 10 a.m. and say, ""Hey, I walked by at 3, you guys were closed. Someone owes me an apology. This jacket would be halfway done!"""
